## How to use the Video calling App

The application is first going to ask you for your cam and audio permission once allowed you can type in the name of the per you want to send a call to in the name field once entered you can then copy the link to clipbord and send that link to your friend who will then paste the link on the "ID to call" field and call the admin who will then add him to the meeting .

And once you are done you can end the call by clickin on the end call button .
